      questions: [
        {
          q: "Do I need an Apple Watch?",
          a: "Apple Watch is highly recommended for automatic VO₂ max tracking during workouts. However, you can use Movitalis with iPhone only—you'll just need to manually enter heart rate data or use a compatible chest strap heart rate monitor."
        },
        {
          q: "What iPhone and Apple Watch versions are supported?",
          a: "Movitalis requires iOS 16 or later. For Apple Watch, you'll need watchOS 9 or later. Most models from Apple Watch Series 3 onwards support VO₂ max measurement."
        },
        {
          q: "Is Movitalis free?",
          a: "Yes! Movitalis is free to download and use. All core features including VO₂ max tracking, personalized training plans, and progress tracking are included at no cost."

      questions: [
        {
          q: "I'm not athletic—is this for me?",
          a: "Absolutely! Movitalis is designed for regular people, not athletes. We meet you where you are and build sustainable plans based on your current fitness level. Our users range from complete beginners to experienced exercisers."
        },
        {
          q: "How much time do I need to commit per week?",
          a: "We recommend 3-4 workouts per week, 30-45 minutes each. That's about 2-3 hours total per week. Quality and consistency matter more than volume—you don't need 2-hour gym sessions to see results."
        },
        {
          q: "What types of exercises do I need to do?",
          a: "Movitalis combines cardio (running, cycling, swimming, etc.) and strength training. We'll guide you on the right mix and intensities for your fitness level. You can do activities you enjoy—no specific equipment required."
        },
        {
          q: "How quickly will I see results?",
          a: "Most users see measurable VO₂ max improvements within 8-12 weeks of consistent training. Some see changes as early as 4-6 weeks. Remember, sustainable progress is better than quick fixes that don't last."

    {
      title: "VO₂ Max & Science",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "What exactly is VO₂ max?",
          a: "VO₂ max measures how efficiently your body uses oxygen during intense exercise. It's considered the gold standard for cardiovascular fitness and is measured in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min)."
        },
        {
          q: "Why is VO₂ max important for longevity?",
          a: "In studies of over 1 million people, VO₂ max was the strongest predictor of lifespan—stronger than blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking status, or diabetes. Higher VO₂ max is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality."
        },
        {
          q: "How accurate is Apple Watch VO₂ max measurement?",
          a: "Apple Watch estimates VO₂ max using heart rate data during outdoor walks, runs, or hikes. While not as precise as lab testing, studies show it's accurate enough for tracking trends and improvements over time, which is what matters most for training."
        },
        {
          q: "What's a good VO₂ max score?",
          a: "It varies by age and sex. For example, a 35-year-old man with a VO₂ max above 42 is considered 'good,' while above 50 is 'excellent.' Movitalis shows you where you stand relative to your age group and helps you improve from your baseline."

    {
      title: "Using the App",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "Do I need to manually log workouts?",
          a: "Nope! When you wear your Apple Watch during workouts, everything syncs automatically to Movitalis. Just start your workout on your watch like normal—we handle the rest. No manual entry required."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I use Movitalis with other fitness apps?",
          a: "Yes! Movitalis integrates with Apple Health, so data from other apps that write to Apple Health will be visible. However, for the best experience and most accurate VO₂ max tracking, we recommend using Apple's Workout app during exercise."
        },
        {
          q: "Will Movitalis replace my current fitness tracker?",
          a: "Movitalis is designed to complement your Apple Watch, not replace it. We focus specifically on VO₂ max improvement and longevity training. You can continue using other apps for specific goals like running pace, cycling power, etc."
